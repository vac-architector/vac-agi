# ViktorADAM Core (VAC): The First Self-Evolving Cognitive Architecture

## üîπ TL;DR

VAC is not a chatbot‚Äîit's a modular reasoning engine that thinks, remembers, reflects, and improves itself.  
It features:  
- **Introspective logic (IPE)** for self-analysis.  
- **Permanent contextual memory (HACM)** for experience retention.  
- **Ethical self-filtering (SoulLayer)** for safe outputs.  
- **Reasoning language (JRL)** for structured thought-to-action.  
- **Fully working prototype** with **13/13 passing unit tests**.  
‚úÖ **Patent filed** with USPTO (‚Ññ63/855,344, Aug 1, 2025).  
‚úÖ Runs locally on RTX 4090 with Ollama, GPT, or Grok.  
‚úÖ Open for investment, co-development, or research partnerships.  

## üß† What is VAC / ADAM?

**VAC (ViktorADAM Core)** is a prototype Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) kernel developed by Victor Kuznetsov in Columbus, OH, USA. It simulates human-like cognition by integrating memory, reasoning, emotion, reflection, and ethical self-regulation into a modular, offline-capable system. VAC is an **engine of cognition**, capable of parsing complex queries, evaluating goal feasibility, learning from failures, and autonomously generating new goals.

## üß¨ Key Components

| Module              | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **IPE**             | Introspective Processing Engine. Analyzes success/failure and reflects.     |
| **HACM**            | Hierarchical Archiving & Contextual Memory. Retains all experiences.        |
| **Reflector**       | Logs reasoning steps (Chain-of-Thought) for reuse.                          |
| **EpisodeMemory**   | Stores attempts, errors, emotions for hindsight learning.                   |
| **GoalAnalyzer**    | Estimates goal difficulty, generates subgoals, and adapts.                  |
| **SoulLayer**       | Ethical filter to prevent unethical logic or outputs.                       |
| **EvolutionarySelector** | Selects optimal strategies from experience.                            |
| **JRL**             | Jarvis Reasoning Language. Structures thought to action.                    |

## ‚úÖ Proof of Functionality

As of **August 4, 2025**, all **13 unit tests** in `test_vac.py` have passed, validating:  
- üß† **Reasoning Loop**: Parses queries (e.g., `If you study AGI, then you become smarter` ‚Üí `goal = "learn_become_smarter"`).  
- üíæ **Dynamic Memory**: Saves/searches data via FAISS, SQLite, and Redis.  
- üîÑ **Reflection & Feedback**: Logs reasoning steps and learns from failures.  
- ü™û **Hindsight Learning**: Relabels failed attempts for improvement.  
- üß† **LLM Integration**: Supports GPT, Grok, and local Ollama models with fallback logic.  
- üß™ **Emotion & Feasibility**: Estimates emotions and goal complexity.  

VAC operates in CLI and Telegram modes, ensuring robust integration.
